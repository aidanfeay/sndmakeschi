  <p>Mallory, Cherisse, Aidan, and John hacked for two and a half days. They played card games, designed, illustrated, programmed and play-tested</p>
  <h3 id="why">Why</h3>
  <p>Platform engages a millenial audience (such as the readers of BuzzFeed Politics, Vox, and Fusion) in localized, offline community building and encourages political participation. In doing so, weâ€™re bridging the gap between news consumers and game players and paving the way for more informative gaming.</p>
  <h3 id="rules">The Rules</h3>
  <p>The rules are simple: the player who controls the most voters wins! In the event of a tie, Iowa Caucus rules: flip a coin.</p>
  <p>The game ends when either all voters are controlled by players or a player reveals the last voter card and every other player plays one last turn.</p>
  <h4>Issues</h4>
  <p>There are 13 issue types, each with two or three different <b>stances</b>. Each issue type is identified with a unique icon. Stances are coded with one of three faces: support, indifference, or opposition</p>
  <h4>Voters</h4>
